Momentum-Based Options Selection & Pricing Model

A Python-based algorithmic trading system that uses historical price momentum and real-time market data to identify and evaluate options contracts using quantitative pricing models.

Project Overview

This project implements an ETL-driven trading research framework designed to:

	•	Extract real-time and historical market data from the Charles Schwab’s Trader API - Individual
	•	Transform raw market data into analysis-ready structures
	•	Load structured data for downstream analytics and storage
	•	Analyze short-term price momentum using minute-level data
	•	Evaluate and select options contracts using the Bjerksund–Stensland pricing model

Goal
Develop a momentum-based options trading strategy that combines:

	•	Intraday price action and trend strength
	•	Theoretical option valuation
	•	Short-term market inefficiencies

Installation
	•	This project is built and tested using Python 3.12.7.  
	•	It is recommended to run the application inside a virtual environment.
